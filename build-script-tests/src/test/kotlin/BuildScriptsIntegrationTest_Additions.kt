/**
 * Placeholder for additional integration/unit tests targeting build-script behaviors.
 *
 * NOTE:
 * - This file will be populated after detecting the project's testing framework (JUnit/Jupiter/Kotest/etc.)
 * - We will append comprehensive tests focusing on the PR diff areas, including happy paths, edge cases, and failure scenarios.
 * - External processes (e.g., Gradle builds) will be isolated/mocked where applicable using existing utilities in the repo.
